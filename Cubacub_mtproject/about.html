        <p>The Kindergarten Center has many important educational tasks, none more important than giving our students the opportunities to become lifelong learners. 
            Our comprehensive instructional programs focus on contemporary research, balanced instruction supported by adequate resources, interventions for children with special needs, and continual in-service training for teachers. These integrated programs reflect the best pedagogical approaches to instruction and are designed to meet the academic, social, physical, and emotional needs of our students.
            The Kindergarten Center provides services for those that qualify including occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, ESL and access to a Student Assistance Counselor. The Kindergarten Center implements a Response to Intervention model for students not reaching their fullest potential. This RTI model allows the parents and teachers to focus on specific goals, document progress through data and then refine the goals as needed.  </p>
